To determine if this statement is supported or contradicted by the given trial information, we need to analyze the results sections of both trials.\n\nPRIMARY TRIAL RESULTS:\nIn the primary trial, the outcome measurement is explicitly mentioned as Objective Response Rate (ORR). It defines an objective response (OR) as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with an objective response. The results provide the ORR for two different arms/groups: Fulvestrant 250 mg (11.1% response rate) and Fulvestrant 250 mg + Loading Dose (17.6% response rate). The unit of measure is given as a percentage of participants.\n\nSECONDARY TRIAL RESULTS:\nIn the secondary trial, the outcome measurement is defined as Objective Response (OR). It is further described as a combination of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0 (RECIST). The results for the specific arm/group, Cohort B, are given, but no participants are reported to have an objective response (OR). The unit of measure is given as the number of participants with OR, and it is reported as 0.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that both the primary trial and the secondary trial utilize Objective Response as the outcome measurement.

To determine if this statement is supported or contradicted by the given trial information, we need to analyze the eligibility criteria.\n\nIn the provided eligibility criteria, there is no mention of patients needing to be bedbound or severely disabled to participate in the primary trial. The criteria primarily focus on the pathologically confirmed breast cancer, the suitability for primary systemic (neoadjuvant) therapy, and the ability to undergo surgical resection of the residual primary tumor following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Other criteria include tumor size, contraindications for primary chemotherapy, planned surgical removal of residual tumor, ability to undergo PET scanning, performance status, various blood count and chemistry requirements, postmenopausal status or surgical sterility for females, ability to comprehend and provide informed consent, and exclusion criteria related to previous treatments and medical conditions.\n\nNowhere in the eligibility criteria does it state or imply that patients must be bedbound or severely disabled to participate in the primary trial.

The outcome measurement is specifically defined in terms of toxicities, including grade 3 or 4 skin/subcutaneous or pulmonary toxicity, clinical fat necrosis, and rib fractures on the ipsilateral treated side. The results are presented as the number of participants who experienced each specific toxicity, and for all categories, the count is reported as 0 (0.0%).\n\nSECONDARY TRIAL RESULTS:\nThe secondary trial focuses on overall tumor response. The best response is recorded using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, which categorize participants' responses as complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, or best response not evaluable. The results provide the numbers of participants falling into each category: 1 participant with complete response, 8 participants with partial response, 14 participants with stable disease, 9 participants with progressive disease, and 3 participants with best response not evaluable.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that both the primary trial and the secondary trial report outcome measures related to the treatment and its effects.
